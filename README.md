# ZIPPI_log
1. using the Sample_dir provided by Prof.Haiqing Zhao to **caculate the 6 metrics** of selected 100 bacteria PDB dimers, (50 from bacteria PDB heterodimers, and 50 from bacteria PDB homodimers),[coding](https://github.com/Xinyua0110/ZIPPI_Sample_dir/tree/6-metrics)
   * mutual information (MI), 
   * conservation (Con) and 
   * direct coupling (DCA). 
   * average product correction (APC) of MI
   * average product correction (APC) of Con
   * average product correction (APC) of DCA

2. Test the caculation on CAPRI benchmark decoys-[score_set](
